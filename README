Hello World, this is my first git-repo. Thank you.

** AUTHOR: Ahmad Mukoshy
** PROJECT: A simple WHMCS module for .tk Domains (Requires DomainShare Account).
** VERSION: 0.1

1) Copy the folder "tkshare" to your {WHMCS-Dir}/modules/registrars/
2) Go go your WHMCS Admin Area
3) Then Setup >> Product/Services >> Domain Registrars
4) Select TKShare and Activate
5) Enter your DomainShare account details and you're Live!

Go to your domain prices and add .tk, select TKShare as the registry and set your pricing!

This version only allows you to register/renew and provide access to domain transfer key 
with a DOT.TK DomainShare account. No domain forwarding or nameservers update yet!
